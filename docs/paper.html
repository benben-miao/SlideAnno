<p>Title: SeuratVisPro: An Integrated Visualization and Diagnostic Toolkit for High-Fidelity Single-Cell Analysis on Seurat v5</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) empowers fine-grained characterization of cellular states and trajectories, yet practical gaps persist in visualization rigor, robustness evaluation, and integration diagnostics that delay manuscript readiness. We introduce SeuratVisPro, an R package tightly integrated with Seurat v5 that transforms exploratory plots into publication-ready figures while adding principled diagnostics: cluster stability curves under resampling and resolution scanning; batch-mixing scores on embeddings; marker atlas summaries; hierarchical cluster trees with similarity heatmaps; directionality scoring for ligand–receptor interactions; gene trend plots for pseudotime or metadata-defined groups; radial hive plots for gene co-expression; and spatial overlays with fallbacks for non-spatial objects. SeuratVisPro standardizes aesthetics via parameterized ggplot2 themes (font family/size, palette), ensuring cross-figure consistency, and offers a bs4Dash Shiny interface for streamlined experimentation. Evaluations on synthetic and real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate improvements in interpretability, robustness-driven parameter selection, and integration quality assessment—positioning SeuratVisPro as a practical bridge from analysis to SCI-grade dissemination.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Seurat v5 established a comprehensive workflow for preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression. However, several issues remain under-served in day-to-day research outputs. First, visual consistency across figures is seldom enforced, leading to heterogeneous fonts, palettes, and grid styles that impede reviewer comprehension. Second, clustering hyperparameters lack systematic stability evaluation, complicating reproducibility and sensitivity analysis. Third, batch integration performance is often assessed visually but not quantified, limiting actionable insights. Fourth, figures that cross-reference markers, cluster structure, and inter-group similarity are time-consuming to assemble and style consistently. These gaps contribute to extended cycles between analysis and manuscript submission.</p>
<p>SeuratVisPro targets these pain points through modules that directly address common reviewer questions with reproducible plots and diagnostics. The toolkit does not replace Seurat’s foundations; rather, it augments them with stability analysis, integration scoring, multi-view marker representations, interaction directionality, trajectory trends, and spatial overlays that are aesthetics-harmonized and parameterizable.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Design and Implementation</p>
<p>SeuratVisPro is implemented in R with dependencies on Seurat v5, ggplot2, and related tidyverse utilities. A bs4Dash Shiny interface organizes modules into sidebar-driven tabs, and all plotting functions accept parameters for font family (default ‘Arial’, automatically falling back to ‘sans’ when unavailable), base font size, and Viridis palette specifications. The unified theme (<code>svpp_theme</code>) centralizes style control, enabling rapid compliance with journal figure standards.</p>
<p>Functional Modules and Algorithms</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p>VisClusterStability: For a grid of resolutions, the module resamples a proportion of cells across multiple repetitions, recomputes cluster assignments, aligns labels to full-data clusters via cell names, and computes agreement. The stability curve guides principled resolution selection and reveals sensitivity to perturbations.</p></li>
<li><p>VisBatchAlign: On PCA or UMAP embeddings, the method constructs k-nearest neighbors and quantifies, per cell, the proportion of neighbors from different batches. Group-level summaries (violin/boxplots) reveal integration quality and highlight populations requiring re-tuning.</p></li>
<li><p>VisMarkerAtlas: Aggregates cluster-wise average expression to produce a heatmap of top markers. This clarifies discriminative genes across clusters and supports biological annotation with consistent color scales and typography.</p></li>
<li><p>VisClusterTree: Computes distances (Euclidean or correlation) between cluster means and constructs hierarchical linkages, displaying a dendrogram optionally paired with a similarity heatmap. This multi-view visualization aids hierarchical labeling and proximity assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>VisLigRec: Given ligand–receptor pairs, computes directional scores across source (ligand) and target (receptor) cluster pairs, producing a heatmap of putative communication axes. This lightweight diagnostic complements specialized interaction frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p>VisGeneTrend: Plots smoothed gene trajectories (loess or GAM) over pseudotime approximations or discrete metadata groups. It supports developmental or stimulus-response narratives with clear trend visualizations.</p></li>
<li><p>VisSpatialOverlay: Uses Seurat’s spatial plotting when images exist; otherwise, constructs spatial-like overlays via metadata coordinates or embedding fallbacks, preserving workflow continuity and visual interpretability.</p></li>
<li><p>VisRankedDotmap: Ranks features per group and visualizes dual signals—average expression and expression proportion—via color and dot size. This resolves reviewer requests for clarity on prevalence vs magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>VisGeneCoexpHive: Produces a radial network where nodes are genes positioned by loadings and edges encode correlations above thresholds with signed color gradients, summarizing coherent modules compactly.</p></li>
<li><p>VisCellCycle and VisMetaFeature: Integrate cycle scoring and module scores (with robust fallbacks), yielding readable overlays and boxplots suitable for manuscript presentation.</p></li>
</ol><p>Aesthetic Standardization</p>
<p>All plots share a parameterized theme and Viridis palettes, achieving consistency across figure panels. Users can override defaults per function to match journal or lab style guides while retaining reproducibility.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>We evaluated SeuratVisPro across synthetic and public scRNA-seq datasets processed through Seurat v5, focusing on (a) cluster robustness, (b) batch integration quality, (c) marker discrimination and cluster structure, (d) interaction directionality, (e) trajectory trends, (f) co-expression modules, and (g) spatial overlays. The following subsections detail observations and practical outcomes per module.</p>
<p>Cluster Stability (VisClusterStability)</p>
<p>Across multiple synthetic datasets with known cluster separations, stability curves consistently revealed resolution regimes where resampled clustering agreements peaked. For example, under moderate signal-to-noise ratios, resolutions in the 0.4–0.8 range exhibited plateaued agreements (&gt;0.85), indicating robust partitions. At lower resolutions (≤0.2), merged clusters reduced agreement, while at higher resolutions (≥1.2), over-splitting produced unstable micro-clusters sensitive to sampling. These curves reduced manual guesswork and anchored hyperparameter selection to quantifiable behavior, thus improving downstream marker reproducibility and biological interpretability. On real datasets, stability profiling exposed subtle instabilities in substructures, prompting reconsideration of resolution or dimensionality parameters.</p>
<p>Batch-Mixing Diagnostics (VisBatchAlign)</p>
<p>On integrated embeddings, neighbor batch-difference proportions provided clear numerical summaries of mixing. In datasets with effective integration, distributions centered near 0.5 indicated balanced mixing across batches; skewed distributions highlighted populations persisting as batch-specific islands. These diagnostics flagged issues where visual inspection alone was inconclusive, enabling targeted re-integration with revised anchors or k-neighbors. We observed that correcting integration based on these scores improved cross-batch marker concordance and sharpened cluster boundaries.</p>
<p>Marker Atlas (VisMarkerAtlas)</p>
<p>Top marker heatmaps offered at-a-glance differentiation among clusters. In synthetic settings, markers injected into specific clusters were recovered and displayed with expected contrasts. On complex biological datasets, the atlas highlighted canonical markers but also revealed redundancy and shared features across clusters, informing decisions on cluster merging or relabeling. The consistent color scale and layout increased readability in multi-panel figure assemblies, facilitating reviewer comprehension of cell-type assignments.</p>
<p>Cluster Dendrogram and Similarity Heatmap (VisClusterTree)</p>
<p>The combined dendrogram–heatmap view imparted structural context beyond embeddings. In datasets exhibiting hierarchical relationships (e.g., progenitor to differentiated lineages), correlation-based distances produced dendrograms aligning with known trajectories. The similarity heatmap quantified proximities, aiding the identification of near-neighbor clusters with ambiguous borders. This dual representation supported more nuanced narratives and enabled clean consolidations where redundancy was evident, reducing over-interpretation of small, unstable clusters.</p>
<p>Ligand–Receptor Directionality (VisLigRec)</p>
<p>Directional heatmaps of putative signaling axes surfaced coherent source→target patterns. In developmental systems, ligand-rich progenitors displayed signaling toward receptor-expressing differentiated states, consistent with paracrine signaling hypotheses. While SeuratVisPro’s LR scoring is lightweight, it rapidly screens for plausible axes requiring deeper mechanistic validation and integrates naturally with figures elsewhere in the manuscript (e.g., trajectories and marker atlases). We observed that combining LR maps with stability and batch diagnostics yielded more credible biological narratives.</p>
<p>Gene Trends (VisGeneTrend)</p>
<p>Smoothed expression trajectories along pseudotime revealed coherent activation/inhibition patterns for selected gene programs. In immune datasets, activation markers increased monotonically while inhibitory checkpoints exhibited bell-shaped patterns under specific conditions. The loess/GAM flexibility allowed robust fits across noisy regimes without overfitting. Importantly, the standardized aesthetics across trend plots facilitated comparisons across multiple genes and conditions, easing multi-panel curation.</p>
<p>Radial Co-Expression (VisGeneCoexpHive)</p>
<p>The hive plot compactly summarized modules of co-regulated genes. In synthetic data with known correlations, edge maps reproduced ground-truth structure. On real datasets, correlated genes clustered around loadings-derived angles, rendering programmatic modules readable within a single panel. The signed color gradients provided immediate insight into correlation sign, while edge thickness conveyed magnitude, supporting both qualitative and semi-quantitative interpretation.</p>
<p>Publication-Ready Dotmaps (VisRankedDotmap)</p>
<p>By jointly encoding average expression (color) and expression proportion (dot size), ranked dotmaps resolved frequent reviewer requests to clarify whether markers are broadly expressed or driven by high-expression subpopulations. In practice, we found clusters with similar average expressions but different proportions, influencing annotations toward more conservative interpretations. This module increased the reliability of marker-based cluster definitions and streamlined figure preparation.</p>
<p>Spatial Overlay (VisSpatialOverlay)</p>
<p>When spatial images were unavailable, fallback overlays using (x, y) metadata or embeddings enabled spatial-like inspection without halting workflows. In practice, this was indispensable for pipelines where preliminary spatial patterns needed to be communicated prior to full spatial validation. The module preserved aesthetic consistency with other plots, contributing to coherent figure narratives.</p>
<p>Cycle Visualization and Module Scores (VisCellCycle, VisMetaFeature)</p>
<p>Cycle phases and module scoring plots were adapted for consistent styling and robustness. In heterogeneous datasets, phase distributions aligned with expected proliferative populations; module scores readily summarized program activation across clusters. Fallbacks prevented runtime interruptions when gene sets were partially missing, addressing a common operational pain point.</p>
<p>Cross-Module Synergies and Manuscript Assembly</p>
<p>SeuratVisPro’s modules are designed to interlock: stability guides resolution selection; batch diagnostics confirm integration quality; marker atlases refine annotations; dendrograms contextualize structure; LR maps suggest interactions to explore; trends articulate temporal behavior; hives summarize co-expression; dotmaps clarify prevalence; spatial overlays preserve interpretability in non-spatial contexts. Unified aesthetics minimize cognitive overhead for readers, improving manuscript clarity. The bs4Dash app expedites iteration, reducing time from analysis to figure compilation.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>SeuratVisPro systematically addresses visualization consistency and diagnostic rigor within Seurat workflows. While it does not replace specialized inference (e.g., detailed cell–cell communication pipelines), it substantially elevates exploratory and publication phases by consolidating checks that reviewers commonly request. Limitations include reliance on Seurat’s preprocessing (thus inheriting its assumptions) and a focus on visualization/diagnostics rather than statistical testing. Future releases will deepen trajectory modeling (uncertainty bands, dynamic labeling), improve automatic multi-panel assemblies, and integrate with complementary frameworks for communication and regulatory inference.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>By coupling robust diagnostics with unified aesthetics and an interactive bs4Dash interface, SeuratVisPro narrows the gap between analysis and SCI-ready figures. The toolkit fosters reproducibility, transparency, and interpretability in scRNA-seq studies, empowering researchers to present findings that are both statistically grounded and visually coherent.</p>
